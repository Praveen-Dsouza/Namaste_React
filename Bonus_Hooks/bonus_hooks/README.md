# useMemo: React Hook that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders.

# useCallback: React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

# useRef: React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.

# useRef will store the value until the component is re-rendered unlike let where the value is again intialized.
