# Assignment-3:
## Laying the Foundation:

1) What is JSX?
Stands for JavaScript XML, We can write HTML and JS within it. It's not a part of react and neither pure JS. JSX 
is not HTML inside JS, It is HTML or XML-like Syntax. Babel transpiles JSX before reaching JS Engine.

2) Superpowers of JSX?
It converts HTML tags into React Elements.
Code Readability.
JSX automatically sanitizes malicious data.
JSX can have single parent on the root.
Can use JSX Fragments (<></>) to wrap all child elements, Fragment behaves like empty tag.

3) Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?
Attributes of JSX are camelcase. To write JSX into multiple lines we wrap with (). We use className instead 
of class, tabindex => tabIndex

4) {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}
All are ways to render the title Component.
