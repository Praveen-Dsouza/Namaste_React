# Assignment-7:
## Finding The Path:

1) What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples?
- The first way to add images in our app using `CDN link`.
## Example:
``` javascript
 <img src = "https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.1d6tBbNiJTFQNEK_k0sSjQHaFj&pid=Api&P=0"/>
```
- The second way to add images in our app using `import`.
## Example:
``` javascript
import {logo} from ".Images/logo.png";

function Header(){
  return(
    <>
    <img src = {logo} />
    </>
  )
}
```
firstly, In this we will store our image in any folder and then we will import that images via folder structure.
The good way of structuring of image folder is "assets/Images/logo.png"

2) What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
useState() returns an array with exactly two values: The current state. During the first render, 
it will match the initialState you have passed. The set function that lets you update the state 
to a different value and trigger a re-render.
[value, fn() ], value => undefined => default value not provided

3) How will useEffect() behave if we don't add a dependency array?
If there is  dependency array not present then useEffect() hook will be called for every time the component renders.

4) What is SPA?
A SPA loads all the app component at once as a Single web document, and update the body content via JS such as fetch(), 
i.e. allows web site to load without any network call to the server.

5) What is the difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
Client Side Routing: When we load a component without any network/API call because all the components are already loaded into app.
Server Side Routing: When we load a component with an network/API call to the server to fetch the page/data and render it on UI, and the whole page is refreshed.
