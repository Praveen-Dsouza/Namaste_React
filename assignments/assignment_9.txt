## Optimising Our App:

1) When and why do we need lazy()?
- When we want to load a chunk or module of a app separately as a different bundle to optimize our app loading time is known as lazy loading.
- Lazy loading makes the large scale application load fast, performant, light weight.
- We import the lazy() function from react library, lazy() takes a callback function and that callback takes an import and it basically takes the path of the component.

2) What is suspense?
- It is a react component given by react library. 
- It will wrap the component that we want to lazy load
- we give a placeholder to fallback so that when react render the component and if the component code is not available, it will display the placeholder passed via fallback. 
- We can pass JSX or a component in fallback.

3) Why we got this error : A component suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced
with a loading indicator. To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition? How does suspense fix this error?
Suspense fix this by showing a placeholder text or component until the code is not loaded.

4) Advantages and disadvantages of using this code splitting pattern?
- Faster Loading time
- Light weight application
- Reduced Intial Bundle Size
- Better Caching and Caching Efficiency
- Optimized Resouce Utilization

Disadvantages:
- Increase Complexity
- Network Round Trips
- Dependencies and Interoperability
- Build Time Overhead

5) When do we and why do we need suspense?
We need suspense so that when the component code is not loaded, we show a placeholder text or component passed 
to fallback.
