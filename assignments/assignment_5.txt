# Assignment-5:
## Lets Get Hooked:

1) What is Virtual Dom?
The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation or copy of the actual DOM structure. It is a JavaScript object 
that reflects the structure and properties of the real DOM elements in your web page.When you make changes to 
your React components, instead of directly updating the real DOM, React updates the Virtual DOM first.

2) What is Reconcilation in React?
It is the process of comparing the new copy of virtual DOM with the previous version to identify the changes or 
updation that are needed to be done to the actual DOM.It optimizes and improves the performance of the UI updates 
and reduces the actual DOM manipulations.(diffing).

3) What is React Fiber?
- React fiber divides the work of rendering and updation process, by breaking the components into smaller, managable units.
- Dividing work: While making changes to the react components, react fiber breaks the work into smaller units known as "fiber".
  Each fiber is a part of the component tree, which can be worked on independently.

4) What is the difference between Named Export, Default Export and * as export?
In a single file we can have only one "default export".
- export default Component;
- import Component from “path”;

When I want to export multiple Components from same file we can use "named export".
- export const Component;
- import { Component } from “path”;

When we want to import all the Component as a single Object we use "* export".
- export const Component
- import * as ObjectName from "path"

Note: Named and * export are Same, named exports can be imported individually and * exports as an Object of names.

5) What is the importance of config.js file?
It is a Configuration file where we define our URLs, Auth_Token etc.

6) What are react Hooks?
A normal JS utility function.

7) Why do we need a useState Hook?
- To make a State Variable, It Maintains the state of the component, When we pass default value to useState.
- It basically is used to manipulate Virtual Dom when any Dom level operations are perfomed.
- It used "Reconciliation Algorithm" aka "React Fiber", basically it compared "Previous Virtual Dom" with "Updated Virtual Dom".
- The Comparison is done using Diff Algorithm.
- Virtual DOM is the representation of actual DOM. Virtual DOM is a Normal JS Object. Virtual DOM uses Diff Algorithm.
- Virtual DOM is an JS Object, It basically compares between Previous Object aka "Previous Virtual DOM" and Updated Object aka "Updated Virtual DOM".
  i.e why it rerenders fast since it compares the Object.
