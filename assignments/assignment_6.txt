# Assignment-6:
## Exploring The World:

1) What is a MicroService?
When each module has it different service, and all this services are brought together to form a larger 
application. They are loosely coupled.

2) What is a Monolith architecture?
When multiple modules are in single codebase to form larger application. They are tightly coupled and it becomes 
difficult to manage as the codebase becomes larger.

3) What is the difference between Monolith and MicroService?
- Monolithic applications typically consist of a client-side UI, a database, and a server-side application. 
  Developers build all of these modules on a single code base.
- MicroService has a distributed architecture, each microservice works to accomplish a single feature or 
  business logic. Instead of exchanging data within the same code base, microservices communicate with an API.

4) Why do we need useEffect Hook?
- It is called after the component is rendered.
- It performs a rendering of data eg from API when the component is loaded first time/reloaded in the application.
- It has a callback function as first argument and dependency array second argument. The callback function will be called as soon as the component is rendered.
- The Dependency array is Optional.

5) What is Optional Chaining?
Optional Chaining access an object property or calls function.If the object accessed or function called 
using this operator is undefined or null, the expression short circuits and evaluates to undefined instead of throwing an error.

6) What is Shimmer UI?
When the App is loading it renders the component the component may have API call so to handle the 
loading time a fake UI is created similar to page data.

7) What is difference between JS expression and JS statement?
The major difference lies in Hoisting.
Code:
a() "Hello A"
b() // TypeError

// Function Expression
function a() {
    console.log("Hello A");
}

// Function Statement
var B = function () {
    console.log("Hello B)
}

Here during memory creation phase a = fn() and b = undefined, So when fn is invoked b is still undefined.

8) What is Conditional Rendering, explain with a code example?
Conditional Rendering is rendering a component based on a condition else set a default, used to handle error in page.

Code:
// Data from API stored in listData
if (listData.length === 0) {
    return "Loading..." or <Shimmer/>
}
render component

9) What is CORS?
CORS is HTTP header based mechanism that allows server to indicate any origins(domain, scheme or port) 
other than it own from which a browser should permit loading access. If two browsers have different ports 
they follow CORS mechanism.Before CORS a preflight aka Options call is made, so if A snd B are applications
A sends -> preflight/Options call -> B
A <- B sends additonal hhtps headers
A can request -> B 

10) What is async and await?
It is cleaner way of writing promises.

11) What is the use of `const json = await data.json();` in getRestaurants
It takes a response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise with the result of parsing body text json.
The result is not JSON but is instead the result of taking JSON as input and parsing it to produce a JavaScript object.
